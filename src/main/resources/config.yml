# Do you want to enable blocking the world from reloading later (i.e. no death gui)?

# If turned off, the player will reload the world every death , which may cause the client to lag.
# Note: After activating this feature, dead players will immediately be set to
# spectator mode, which may result in a lack of kill feedback. At present,
# this function does not have any related compensation function.

# after: Set health to greater than 0 immediately upon death to prevent the client from displaying it
# Death interface, but when not synchronized, the client will display abnormal player status
# The probability of the player dying but still able to continue walking is relatively high at 1.9+,
# Since this is not a plugin issue, it cannot be fixed. You can use the 'before' mode instead
#
# before: Similar to a popular server that start with "h", cancel the damage that caused death this time
# But it will result in the final damage without animation and sound. You can
# Enable the 'preventloadworldModebefore-animfix' option for repair (this will also fix sound)
